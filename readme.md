# Joke Generator

This is the fifth project of Brad Traversy's "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning" course on Udemy. This was mostly an excuse to play around with an external API - in this case, a Chuck Norris joke database. I incorporated a more organized CSS architecture than was provided in the course, including SASS, CSS Grid, modular CSS files, BEM methodology (I did not want to use Skeleton, which is what Brad used for the project). Aside from this, I mostly replicated the project exactly as instructed, though I opted to use Gulp and Webpack for various tasks.
